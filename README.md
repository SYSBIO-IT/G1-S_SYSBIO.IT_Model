# G1-S_SYSBIO.IT_Model
The model focuses on the core mechanism of cell size control in steady state growth, no consideration being given yet on how changes in nutrients or growth rate affect cell size. A novel and conceptually simple mathematical model of the G1/S network is proposed, centered on the phosphorylation of Whi5, an inhibitor of G1/S-specific transcription. Although our model includes all known molecular players of the G1/S transition, only few critical parameters (that affect Whi5 phosphorylation) determine its most important functions. Model predictions have been validated by analyzing cell cycle entry and transcriptional activation in mutants expressing a Whi5 protein with constitutive (pseudo)phosphorylation. The model accounts for different data sets that were not considered in model design and parameter optimization, thereby providing a new unifying, comprehensive, molecular mechanism for the core critical cell size control and for the mitosis/mating switch.
